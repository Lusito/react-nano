Lightweight fetching hooks for react, written in TypeScript.

### Why Use @react-nano/use-fetch?

- Very lightweight (see the badges above for the latest size).
- Flexible and dead simple to use.
- Written in TypeScript
- Only has one required peer dependency: React 16.8.0 or higher.
- Liberal license: [zlib/libpng](https://github.com/Lusito/react-nano/blob/master/LICENSE)

**Beware**: This is currently work in progress. The API might change.

There are a lot of similar hooks out there, but they either lacked something I needed or seemed overly complicated to use.
