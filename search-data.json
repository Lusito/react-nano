You can enable the &quot;hash&quot; mode on the Router component:\nimport { Router } from &quot;@react-nano/router&quot;;\nexport const App = () =&gt; &lt;Router mode=&quot;hash&quot;&gt;....&lt;/Router&gt;;\n\nThis will result in a url like https://some-domain.com/#/News instead of https://some-domain.com/News.\nThis approach will still use the history API internally!\nUsing a Basename\nIf your app is not located at the root directory of a server, but instead in a sub-directory, you'll want to specify that sub-directory. Basename will then automatically be prefixed on Link components.\nimport { Router } from &quot;@react-nano/router&quot;;\nexport const App = () =&gt; &lt;Router basename=&quot;/my-app&quot;&gt;....&lt;/Router&gt;;\n\nIf you have a &lt;base&gt; tag in your HTML, this can be easily detected using the getBasename() helper. That way you don't have to hard-code it:\nimport { Router, getBasename } from &quot;@react-nano/router&quot;;\nexport const App = () =&gt; &lt;Router basename={getBasename()}&gt;....&lt;/Router&gt;;\n\nCustom Route Matching\nThis library doesn't force a route matching algorithm on you, but it comes with a lightweight one built-in.\nThe built-in route matching algorithm only allows exact matches and a &quot;match everything&quot; (&quot;*&quot;) though.\nIf you need something more sophisticated, you'll have to supply a factory. Here is a simple example using the popular path-to-regexp library:\nimport { pathToRegexp, Key } from &quot;path-to-regexp&quot;;\nimport { Router, RouteParams } from &quot;@react-nano/router&quot;;\n\nfunction routeMatcherFactory(pattern: string) {\n  const keys: Key[] = [];\n  const regex = pathToRegexp(pattern, keys);\n\n  return (path: string) =&gt; {\n    const out = regex.exec(path);\n\n    if (!out) return null;\n\n    return keys.reduce((params, key, i) =&gt; {\n      params[key.name] = out[i + 1];\n      return params;\n    }, {} as RouteParams);\n  };\n}\n\nexport const App = () =&gt; &lt;Router routeMatcherFactory={routeMatcherFactory}&gt;....&lt;/Router&gt;;\n\nUsing pathToRegexp allows to extract named parameters from a pattern like &quot;/users/:name&quot;.\nI.e. if the path is &quot;/users/Zaphod&quot;, then the param with the key &quot;name&quot; would have the value &quot;Zaphod&quot;.\n","title":"Router","projectIndex":{"title":"router","url":"https://lusito.github.io/react-nano/router/"}},{"url":"https://lusito.github.io/react-nano/router/routes.html","content":"Routes\nRoute\nShowing a component if the location matches a certain path is done with a Route component.

Use a Switch component if that's not desired.\nAs you can see, it's possible to specify a component to render or normal children.\nYou can even use a callback instead of children like this:\nexport const Component = () =&gt; (\n    &lt;Route path=&quot;/foo/:id&quot;&gt;{(params: { id: string }) =&gt; &lt;div&gt;Bar {params.id}&lt;/div&gt;}&lt;/Route&gt;;\n);\n\nSee further below for the the possibility of using parameters.\nSwitch\nIf you only want the first Route that has a matching path to be shown, you can use a Switch:\nexport const Component = () =&gt; (\n  &lt;Switch&gt;\n    &lt;Route path=&quot;/news&quot; component={News} /&gt;\n    &lt;Route path=&quot;/fakenews&quot; component={FakeNews} /&gt;\n    {/* use &quot;(.*)&quot;  instead of &quot;*&quot; if you use path-to-regexp */}\n    &lt;Route path=&quot;*&quot; component={Otherwise} /&gt;\n  &lt;/Switch&gt;\n);\n\nNote: The path pattern for the &quot;Otherwise&quot; Route differs depending on your route matching algorithm. With the built-in simpleRouteMatcherFactory you would use &quot;*&quot;, while you would use &quot;(.*)&quot; or &quot;/:fallback&quot; for path-to-regexp.\nAdding Parameters\nWhen you use a custom matching algorithm like path-to-regexp, you can extract values from the path. Let's say you have this route:\nexport const Component = () =&gt; &lt;Route path=&quot;/news/:id&quot; component={News} /&gt;;\n\nYou defined a parameter :id in your path. Now you can access it in your News component:\nexport const News = (props: RouteComponentProps&lt;{ id: string }&gt;) =&gt; &lt;div&gt;News ID: {props.params.id}&lt;/div&gt;;\n\nFresh Rendering\nLet's say you have this route:\nexport const Component = () =&gt; &lt;Route path=&quot;/news/:id&quot; component={News} /&gt;;\n\nMoving from /news/1 to /news/2 will only update the components properties. State will be preserved.\nIf you want to force the component to be created from scratch in this situation, you can do so by setting the property addKey (boolean).\nThis will add the key property to the component with a value of the current path.\n","title":"Routes","projectIndex":{"title":"router","url":"https://lusito.github.io/react-nano/router/"}},{"url":"https://lusito.github.io/react-nano/router/setup.html","content":"Setup\nThis library is shipped as es2015 modules.

See helper functions for more details.\nAdditionally, since prepareFormDataPost sets init.method to &quot;POST&quot;, we override this here with a &quot;PUT&quot;.\nIn this case, we expect the server to return true on success, so the result type is boolean.\nAside from that there is nothing special going on here.\n\nUsing the Custom Fetch Hook\nHere's how you might use the hook (in addition to useGetUser from the previous example):\nfunction EditUserComponent(props: { id: number }) {\n  const [getUser] = useGetUser({ autoSubmit: { id: props.id } });\n  const [updateUser, submitUpdateUser] = useUpdateUserFetch();\n\n  if (getUser.failed) return &lt;div&gt;Error fetching user&lt;/div&gt;;\n  if (!getUser.success) return &lt;div&gt;Loading..&lt;/div&gt;;\n\n  const user = getUser.data;\n  const validationErrors = getValidationErrors(updateUser);\n\n  return (\n    &lt;Form\n      onSubmit={(e) =&gt; submitUpdateUser({ id: props.id, formData: new FormData(e.currentTarget) })}\n      loading={updateUser.loading}\n    &gt;\n      &lt;Input name=&quot;name&quot; label=&quot;Name&quot; placeholder=&quot;Name&quot; error={validationErrors.name} defaultValue={user.name} /&gt;\n      ...\n      &lt;ErrorMessageForState state={updateUser} /&gt;\n      &lt;button type=&quot;submit&quot;&gt;Save&lt;/button&gt;\n    &lt;/Form&gt;\n  );\n}\n\nThere's a lot more going on here:\n\nIn addition to getting the user, which we already did in the first example,\nWe're also using the useUpdateUserFetch hook. No autoSubmit config means we need to call it manually.\n\nThe second entry in the returned array is a submit function, which you can call to manually (re-)submit the request.\n\n\nThe server returns a validation hashmap in case of an error (implementation is up to you).\nWe're using some pseudo UI library to define our user form:\n\nonSubmit is passed on to the &lt;form&gt; element, so we get notified of submits.\n\nOn submit, we create a new FormData object from the &lt;form&gt; element.\nThe biggest advantage of this is that you don't need to connect all of your input elements to your components state.\n\n\nWhen an error happened, we try to show some information about it. See API for more information on the state values.\n\n\n\nIn case you are wondering about the implementations of ErrorMessageForState and getValidationErrors, here they are:\ninterface ErrorMessageForStateProps {\n  state: FetchState&lt;any, RestValidationErrorDTO&gt;;\n}\n\nexport function ErrorMessageForState({ state }: ErrorMessageForStateProps) {\n  switch (state.state) {\n    case &quot;error&quot;:\n      return &lt;div&gt;Error {state.error.error}&lt;/div&gt;;\n    case &quot;exception&quot;:\n      return &lt;div&gt;Error {state.error.message}&lt;/div&gt;;\n    default:\n      return null;\n  }\n}\n\nexport function getValidationErrors(state: FetchState&lt;any, RestValidationErrorDTO&gt;) {\n  return (state.state === &quot;error&quot; &amp;&amp; state.error.validation_errors) || {};\n}\n\n","title":"Example: Modify Data","projectIndex":{"title":"use-fetch","url":"https://lusito.github.io/react-nano/use-fetch/"}},{"url":"https://lusito.github.io/react-nano/use-fetch/setup.html","content":"Setup\nThis library is shipped as es2017 modules.
