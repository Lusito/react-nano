If you specify an onClick property and it calls preventDefault(), then the history change will not happen, as would be the case with any normal link.\nLinkButton, Etc.\nIf you want to create a LinkButton or similar, you can do that easily. This is the implementation of Link:\nexport function Link(props: React.PropsWithChildren&lt;LinkProps&gt;) {\n    const routeLink = useRouteLink(props.href, props.onClick);\n    return &lt;a {...props} href={routeLink.href} onClick={routeLink.onClick} /&gt;;\n}\n\nCreating a LinkButton is as simple as this:\nimport { useRouteLink } from &quot;@react-nano/router&quot;;\n...\nexport function LinkButton(props: React.PropsWithChildren&lt;LinkButtonProps&gt;) {\n    const routeLink = useRouteLink(props.href, props.onClick);\n    return &lt;button {...props} onClick={routeLink.onClick} /&gt;;\n}\n\n","title":"Links, etc.","projectIndex":{"title":"router","url":"https://lusito.github.io/react-nano/router/"}},{"url":"https://lusito.github.io/react-nano/router/router.html","content":"Router\nYou'll need to add a Router component in your app (just one).

You can enable the &quot;hash&quot; mode on the Router component:\nimport { Router } from &quot;@react-nano/router&quot;;\nexport const App = () =&gt; (\n    &lt;Router mode=&quot;hash&quot;&gt;\n        ....\n    &lt;/Router&gt;\n);\n\nThis will result in a url like https://some-domain.com/#/News instead of https://some-domain.com/News.\nThis approach will still use the history API internally!\nUsing a Basename\nIf your app is not located at the root directory of a server, but instead in a sub-directory, you'll want to specify that sub-directory. Basename will then automatically be prefixed on Link components.\nimport { Router } from &quot;@react-nano/router&quot;;\nexport const App = () =&gt; (\n    &lt;Router basename=&quot;/my-app&quot;&gt;\n        ....\n    &lt;/Router&gt;\n);\n\nIf you have a &lt;base&gt; tag in your HTML, this can be easily detected using the getBasename() helper. That way you don't have to hard-code it:\nimport { Router, getBasename } from &quot;@react-nano/router&quot;;\nexport const App = () =&gt; (\n    &lt;Router basename={getBasename()}&gt;\n        ....\n    &lt;/Router&gt;\n);\n\nCustom Route Matching\nThis library doesn't force a route matching algorithm on you, but it comes with a lightweight one built-in.\nThe built-in route matching algorithm only allows exact matches and a &quot;match everything&quot; (&quot;*&quot;) though.\nIf you need something more sophisticated, you'll have to supply a factory. Here is a simple example using the popular path-to-regexp library:\nimport { pathToRegexp, Key } from &quot;path-to-regexp&quot;;\nimport { Router, RouteParams } from &quot;@react-nano/router&quot;;\n\nfunction routeMatcherFactory(pattern: string) {\n    const keys: Key[] = [];\n    const regex = pathToRegexp(pattern, keys);\n\n    return (path: string) =&gt; {\n        const out = regex.exec(path);\n\n        if (!out) return null;\n\n        return keys.reduce((params, key, i) =&gt; {\n            params[key.name] = out[i + 1];\n            return params;\n        }, {} as RouteParams);\n    }\n}\n\nexport const App = () =&gt; (\n    &lt;Router routeMatcherFactory={routeMatcherFactory}&gt;\n        ....\n    &lt;/Router&gt;\n);\n\nUsing pathToRegexp allows to extract named parameters from a pattern like &quot;/users/:name&quot;.\nI.e. if the path is &quot;/users/Zaphod&quot;, then the param with the key &quot;name&quot; would have the value &quot;Zaphod&quot;.\n","title":"Router","projectIndex":{"title":"router","url":"https://lusito.github.io/react-nano/router/"}},{"url":"https://lusito.github.io/react-nano/router/routes.html","content":"Routes\nRoute\nShowing a component if the location matches a certain path is done with a Route component. It takes a path prop and either a component prop or children.\nexport const Component = () =&gt; (\n    &lt;div&gt;\n        &lt;Route path=&quot;/news&quot; component={News} /&gt;\n        &lt;Route path=&quot;/fakenews&quot;&gt;Drumpf&lt;/Route&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n);\n\nBeware: If multiple routes have a matching path, all will be shown. Use a Switch component if that's not desired.\nAs you can see, it's possible to specify a component to render or normal children.\nYou can even use a callback instead of children like this:\nexport const Component = () =&gt; (\n    &lt;Route path=&quot;/foo/:id&quot;&gt;{(params: { id: string }) =&gt; &lt;div&gt;Bar {params.id}&lt;/div&gt;}&lt;/Route&gt;;\n);\n\nSee further below for the the possibility of using parameters.\nSwitch\nIf you only want the first Route that has a matching path to be shown, you can use a Switch:\nexport const Component = () =&gt; (\n    &lt;Switch&gt;\n        &lt;Route path=&quot;/news&quot; component={News} /&gt;\n        &lt;Route path=&quot;/fakenews&quot; component={FakeNews} /&gt;\n        {/* use &quot;(.*)&quot;  instead of &quot;*&quot; if you use path-to-regexp */}\n        &lt;Route path=&quot;*&quot; component={Otherwise} /&gt;\n    &lt;/Switch&gt;\n);\n\nNote: The path pattern for the &quot;Otherwise&quot; Route differs depending on your route matching algorithm. With the built-in simpleRouteMatcherFactory you would use &quot;*&quot;, while you would use &quot;(.*)&quot; or &quot;/:fallback&quot;  for path-to-regexp.\nAdding Parameters\nWhen you use a custom matching algorithm like path-to-regexp, you can extract values from the path. Let's say you have this route:\nexport const Component = () =&gt; (\n    &lt;Route path=&quot;/news/:id&quot; component={News} /&gt;\n);\n\nYou defined a parameter :id in your path. Now you can access it in your News component:\nexport const News = (props: RouteComponentProps&lt;{ id: string }&gt;) =&gt; (\n    &lt;div&gt;News ID: {props.params.id}&lt;/div&gt;\n);\n\nFresh Rendering\nLet's say you have this route:\nexport const Component = () =&gt; &lt;Route path=&quot;/news/:id&quot; component={News} /&gt;;\n\nMoving from /news/1 to /news/2 will only update the components properties. State will be preserved.\nIf you want to force the component to be created from scratch in this situation, you can do so by setting the property addKey (boolean).\nThis will add the key property to the component with a value of the current path.\n","title":"Routes","projectIndex":{"title":"router","url":"https://lusito.github.io/react-nano/router/"}},{"url":"https://lusito.github.io/react-nano/router/setup.html","content":"Setup\nThis library is shipped as es2015 modules.

This is just kept short for an overview!\n    if (!userState.success) return &lt;div&gt;Loading&lt;/div&gt;;\n\n    // Unless you checked for userState.state === &quot;success&quot; (or userState.success), userState.data will not exist on the type.\n    const user = userState.data;\n    return (\n        &lt;ul&gt;\n            &lt;li&gt;Name: {user.name}&lt;/li&gt;\n            &lt;li&gt;Icon: &lt;img src={user.icon} alt=&quot;User Icon&quot; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n            &lt;li&gt;Age: {user.age /* Error: No property &#x27;age&#x27; on user! */}&lt;/li&gt;\n            &lt;li&gt;Posts:\n                &lt;ul&gt;\n                    {user.posts.map((post) =&gt; (\n                        &lt;li key={post.id}&gt;{post.title} with {post.hits} hits&lt;/li&gt;\n                    ))}\n                &lt;/ul&gt;\n            &lt;/li&gt;\n        &lt;/ul&gt;\n    );\n}\n\n\nIn the above example, the type of userState.data is automatically created by inspecting the attribute choices specified in the fields definition of your hook.\nSo, even though UserDTO specifies the properties id and age and PostDTO specifies message and user, they will not end up in the returned data type and will lead to a compile-time error when you try to access them. For all other properties you will get autocompletion and type-safety.\nTo use the above example, you'll need to define your full types somewhere (i.e. all types and attributes that could possibly be requested):\nimport { GraphGLVariableTypes } from &quot;@react-nano/use-graphql&quot;;\n\nexport interface ErrorDTO {\n    message: string;\n}\n\nexport interface PostDTO {\n    id: number;\n    title: string;\n    message: string;\n    hits: number;\n    user: UserDTO;\n}\n\nexport interface UserDTO {\n    id: string;\n    name: string;\n    icon: string;\n    age: number;\n    posts: PostDTO[];\n}\n\nexport interface QueryUserVariables {\n    id: string;\n}\n\n// Also specify GraphQL variable types as a constant like this:\nconst queryUserVariableTypes: GraphGLVariableTypes&lt;QueryUserVariables&gt; = {\n    // These will be autocompleted (and are required) based on the type argument above\n    // The values here are the only place where you still need to write GraphQL types.\n    id: &quot;String!&quot;,\n};\n\n\nHow to Use\nCheck out the documentation\nReport Issues\nSomething not working quite as expected?

/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n            &lt;li&gt;Posts:\n                &lt;ul&gt;\n                    {user.posts.map((post) =&gt; (\n                        &lt;li key={post.id}&gt;{post.title} with {post.hits} hits&lt;/li&gt;\n                    ))}\n                &lt;/ul&gt;\n            &lt;/li&gt;\n        &lt;/ul&gt;\n    );\n}\n\nThe State Object\nThe state object always has these properties:\n\nloading: boolean =&gt; Request is currently in progress\nfailed: boolean; =&gt; Either an exception occurred or the request returned an error\nsuccess: boolean; =&gt; Request was successful\ntype: &quot;empty&quot; | &quot;success&quot; | &quot;error&quot; | &quot;exception&quot; =&gt; The last known state of the request (a new request might be in progress)\n\nDepending on type, additional properties might be available:\n\n&quot;empty&quot; =&gt; This is the initial state if no request has returned yet\n\nfailed will always be false\nsuccess will always be false\n\n\n&quot;success =&gt; This is the state when a request returned successful.\n\nfailed will always be false\nsuccess will always be true\nresponseStatus: number; =&gt; The status code of the response\nresponseHeaders: Headers; =&gt; The headers of the response\ndata: ResultType =&gt; The server result\n\n\n&quot;error&quot; =&gt; The server responded with an error.\n\nfailed will always be true\nsuccess will always be false\nresponseStatus: number; =&gt; The status code of the response\nresponseHeaders: Headers; =&gt; The headers of the response\nerrors: ErrorType[]; =&gt; The list of errors returned by the server\n\n\n&quot;exception&quot; =&gt; An exception has been thrown in JavaScript\n\nfailed will always be true\nsuccess will always be false\nerrors: Error; =&gt; The error that has been thrown\n\n\n\nThe Submit Function\nThe submit function arguments depend on wether you defined variables in your hook:\n\nIf you defined variables, you'll need to pass them as an object to the submit function.\n\nE.g. submit({ id: &quot;hello&quot; });\n\n\nOtherwise, call the submit function without arguments.\n\nThe Abort Function\nThis function is simple. It takes no arguments and stops the request.\n","title":"Your GraphQL Hook","projectIndex":{"title":"use-graphql","url":"https://lusito.github.io/react-nano/use-graphql/"}},{"url":"https://lusito.github.io/react-nano/use-graphql/setup.html","content":"Setup\nThis library is shipped as es2015 modules.
