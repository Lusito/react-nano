# @react-nano/use-fetch

Lightweight fetching hooks for react, written in TypeScript.

## Overview

- Flexible and dead simple to use.
- Written in TypeScript
- Only has one required peer dependency: React 16.8.0 or higher.

**Beware**: This is currently work in progress. The API might change.

There are a lot of similar hooks out there, but they either lacked something I needed or seemed overly complicated to use.
